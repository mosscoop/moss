            Moss works toward creating genuinely affordable, environmentally sustainable community-led housing. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Our development should beÂ embedded in and contribute to the local community. We believe less renter turnover can lead to stronger long-term relationships.
        </li>
        <li>
            We strive to support similar projects through knowledge and advice sharing, and eventually through financial means. 
        </li>
        <li>
            As a co-operative, we value knowledge sharing, collaboration, democratic decision-making.
        </li>
        <li>
            Where possible, we strive to remove barriers to financially and environmentally sustainable housing such as lack of capital, through decommodifying housing and creating housing that is affordable in perpetuity
        </li>
        <li>
            We aim for the most environmentally sustainable housing possible, envisioning energy efficiency, water capture, renewable on-site energy, and supporting biodiversity through encouraging native flora and fauna. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Moss values striking a healthier balance between communal and private residential spaces.
